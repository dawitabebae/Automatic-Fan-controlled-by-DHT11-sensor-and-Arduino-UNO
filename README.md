# Fan controlled by DHT11 sensor and arduino
This project demonstrate the use of DHT11 sensor and arduino to control a fan or AC automatically.
# components and tools
- Arduino UNO
- DHT11 sensor
- Resistors
- Motor or LED for demonstration
- Proteus 8 pro for *simulation*
- Bread board and Jumper wires *designing*
# How it works
It uses the sensor to feed the temperature and himudity data into the arduino so the arduino can control the fan based on the input value from the DHT11 sensor and the parameters wrote on the C++ arduino program.
